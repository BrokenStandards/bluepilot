<details><summary><h3>💭 Updates on Branch Names and Links</h3></summary>

---

As of May 2025, we are updating the way branches are named and how links are generated. We had initially intended to use a branch naming system similar to openpilot and sunnypilot where there was a "stable" or "release" branch which included all fully vetted code, and then "staging" or "beta" branches with new code that would eventually move into the stable/release branches.  However as we evolved we found everyone liked being able to bounce between newer and older branches to compare features and control. Moving forwards all releases will simply be named bp-"feature release number" as an example "staging-1.1" which features the bluepilot 1.1 features (custom tuning) will become "bp-1.1".  We will not delete older branches so that anyone can go back and view older code for references.  Branches that no longer work properly will be denoted as -deprecated.

To install any version of bluepilot, use the following URL formula (URL is case sensitive)

installer.comma.ai/BluePilotDev/"branch name"

For example

installer.comma.ai/BluePilotDev/bp-7.0

will install the **bp-7.0** branch (current release, synced with sunnypilot master as of June 10, 2026).  Branches known to no longer work due to changes in the comma codebase will be appended with -deprecated so it will be obvious they will not install or work correctly.

<details><summary><h3>🌞 What is bluepilot?</h3></summary>

---

[bluepilot](https://github.com/bluepilotdev/bluepilot) is a fork of the hugely popular SunnyPilot project for the comma 3X and comma 4.  The goal of BluePilot is to develop, test, and stage Ford specific enhancements, validating them before submission to the SunnyPilot team for inclusion in the parent project.  BluePilot is always based upon sunnypilot's master branch.

**BluePilot bp-7.0** is synced with **sunnypilot master (June 10, 2026, openpilot 0.11.2 base)** and includes all upstream sunnypilot features plus Ford-specific enhancements. This release runs on AGNOS 18.4 and supports both the comma 3X and the comma 4.

### Upstream SunnyPilot Features
BluePilot includes **all** features from the upstream SunnyPilot project. For complete sunnypilot documentation:
* **[sunnypilot documentation](https://docs.sunnypilot.ai/)** - Features, installation, and FAQ
* **[README_SP.md](README_SP.md)** - The upstream sunnypilot README

Key upstream features include: MADS (Modular Assistive Driving System), Neural Network Lateral Control (NNLC), Dynamic Experimental Control (DEC), Speed Limit Assist (SLA), Intelligent Cruise Button Management (ICBM, extended to Ford by BluePilot), Smart Cruise Control Map & Vision (SCC-M / SCC-V), Driving Model Manager, sunnylink integration, and much more.

<details><summary><h3>⛔ Prohibited Safety Modifications</h3></summary>

---

All [official sunnypilot branches](https://github.com/sunnyhaibin/sunnypilot/branches) strictly adhere to [comma.ai's safety policy](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/blob/master/docs/SAFETY.md). Any changes that go against this policy will result in your fork and your device being banned from both comma.ai and sunnypilot channels. This same stipulation applies to all bluepilot instances as well.

The following changes are a **VIOLATION** of this policy and **ARE NOT** included in any sunnypilot branches:
* Driver Monitoring:
    * ❌ "Nerfing" or reducing monitoring parameters.
* Panda safety:
    * ❌ No preventing disengaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal press.
    * ❌ No auto re-engaging of <ins>**LONGITUDINAL CONTROL**</ins> (acceleration/brake) on brake pedal release.
    * ❌ No disengaging on ACC MAIN in OFF state.

<details><summary><h3>🚗 BluePilot Specific Features - bp-7.0</h3></summary>

## What's New in bp-7.0

BluePilot 7.0 is a **major update** synced with sunnypilot master (June 10, 2026, openpilot 0.11.2 base) on AGNOS 18.4, headlined by a second, selectable Ford lateral control scheme with full panda safety enforcement.

### Angle-Primary Lateral Control (New)
A second Ford steering strategy, selectable at any time from the settings menu (no reinstall or reboot):

* **Primary Control Variable selector** - Choose between Curvature (the proven 4-signal strategy from previous releases) and Angle (path_angle as the primary actuator)
* **Per-platform tuning built in** - Separate gain defaults for CAN vehicles (Escape, Bronco Sport, Maverick, Edge), CAN-FD trucks (F-150, Lightning, Expedition, Ranger), and CAN-FD SUVs (Mustang Mach-E, Escape MK4.5)
* **Variable lookahead** - Model lookahead time adapts to speed and curve depth for earlier, smoother curve entry without early unwind at the apex
* **PSCM saturation handling** - Detects when the steering module is at its authority limit and manages the command to avoid snap corrections on release
* **User feel adjustments** - Low Speed and High Speed Adjustment Factors plus an angle-specific Lane Change Factor

### Panda Safety for Angle Mode
Angle mode runs under full panda safety enforcement, not a bypass:

* The safety firmware corroborates that angle mode is genuinely engaged through a redundant CAN channel before accepting angle-mode frames
* A shadow curvature cross-check continuously validates the commanded steering intent against the measured vehicle motion
* path_angle rate-of-change limits are enforced independently on the panda, tuned to the actual control cadence
* Full regression test coverage in the safety test suite, validated against recorded real-world routes with a replay harness

### Per-Scheme Tuning Parameters
Curvature and angle control no longer share any tuning values:

* Every lateral tuning parameter now belongs to exactly one scheme (curvature or angle)
* Switching schemes never overwrites or reuses the other scheme's tuning; each keeps its own values
* Existing settings migrate automatically on first boot after updating; no retuning required

### Settings Menu Reorganization
* **Nested lateral tuning sections** - Lateral Tuning now contains collapsible Angle Tuning and Curvature Tuning sub-sections; the disable toggle and scheme selector sit at the top
* Controls for the unselected scheme stay visible but grey out, so both tuning sets are always discoverable (comma 3X)
* Cleaned up and reorganized comma 4 menus, with an on-device vehicle selector and integer/float value pickers on both platforms

### SunnyLink Remote Settings
* **Ford BluePilot settings under the "vehicle" panel in sunnylink** - Configure BluePilot from the sunnylink interface, grouped by System, Vehicle, Visuals, Longitudinal Tuning, and Lateral Tuning
* Scheme-aware: angle and curvature tuning entries appear only when their control scheme is selected, with the same dependency gating as the on-device menu

### Connect Backend
* **Connect Backend** - Choose Comma Connect (stock servers), Konik Stable (stable.konik.ai), or Offline Mode (unreachable hosts so uploads never succeed)
* Dongle ID switches automatically between Comma and Konik and is cached per backend, so switching is reversible in both directions with a reboot
* Pairing QR codes and instructions follow the selected backend

### Visuals
* **Rainbow Lane Lines** - Inner lane lines become rainbow colored when longitudinal control is active
* **Minimal Driving View** - Hide the camera feed and show only lane lines and the model path
* **Show Lateral Control Mode** - Steering wheel icon overlay showing the active lateral scheme
* Steering arc fix for the comma 3X, with reduced false left-steer bias from road roll

### Platform & Stability
* Synced with sunnypilot master (June 10, 2026): Chrysler CUSW, Rivian, Tesla, Honda, and Hyundai updates, lateralManeuverPlan support, updated panda/msgq/rednose submodules
* AGNOS 18.4 with the AGNOS thermal framework managing CPU frequency (replaces the static frequency cap)
* Display initialization fixes for git-clone installs (EGL/GLES driver re-pointing on boot)
* is_bluepilot() detection system; all stock file overrides are guarded and labeled for clean upstream merges
* Ford opendbc code refactored into a sunnypilot extension layer, with the safety test harness synced to upstream

### BluePilot Settings & Tuning

The following settings are available in the BluePilot menu:

**System:**
* UI Debug Logging
* Connect Backend (Comma Connect / Konik Stable / Offline Mode)
* Preferred WiFi Network
* Clear Crashed Model
* Reset Menu Layout

**Vehicle:**
* Show BlueCruise UI on Cluster (supported digital dashes)

* Show Confidence Ball (comma 3X)
* Animate Steering Wheel
* Show Lateral Control Mode
* Show Radar Lead Overlay (Ford ACC) with size selection
* Hybrid/EV Battery Status, Power Flow, gauge size and style options
* Lower Right Display selector (comma 4)

**Longitudinal Tuning:**
* Bypass BP Longitudinal Control
* Coasting Mode (Legacy / Extended — Extended restores the stock Ford coast band: decel up to -0.45 m/s² rides the propulsion channel as engine braking/regen before the friction brakes engage)
* Disable Downhill Compensation
* Disable Ford Radar (Vision-Only Leads)

**Lateral Tuning:**
* Disable BP Lateral Control
* Primary Control Variable (Curvature / Angle)
* Disable Lane Change Under Speed, with minimum speed selector
* Angle Tuning: Low Speed Adjustment Factor, High Speed Adjustment Factor, Lane Change Factor High
* Curvature Tuning: Human Turn Detection, Lane Change Factor High, Lane Positioning, In-Lane Offset, Lanefull Mode, Custom Tuning Profile, Predicted Curvature Blend Ratios (High/Low), Centering PID Gain
